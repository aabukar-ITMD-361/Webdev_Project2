        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hello, my name is Huzaifa Anis. I am currently a sophomore at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), majoring in Cybersecurity & IT.</li>
          <li>Previously, I was a computer engineering major; however, I switched my major going into my sophomore year as I figured cybersecurity was a better fit for me.</li>
          <li>I decided to pursue cybersecurity because of its exciting career opportunities. Growing up, I was always fascinated by tech and engineering, so I believe cybersecurity is the perfect fit for me.</li>
          <li>Below, I'll share more about myself and my interests outside of college.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Born and raised in the Rogers Park area of Chicago.</li>
          <li>Currently living in Lincolnwood, IL.</li>
          <li>Originally from Karachi, Pakistan.</li>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In this section, I’ll provide a more detailed version of myself.</li>
          <li>I work part-time while attending college full-time. I work at Floor & Decor as a Pro Specialist, where I interact with contractors and customers daily.</li>
          <li>Ultimately, it's a sales position, which I enjoy because of the variety of people I meet, such as contractors, real estate developers, DIY customers, and more.</li>
          <li>In addition, I’m also a coach for the First Lego League and the First Robotics Competition, where I mentor middle and high school students, teaching them how to program, design, and build.</li>
          <li>I’ve loved FIRST Robotics ever since middle school and have been a part of the organization throughout my middle and high school years. I was the coach of my high school team and had the opportunity to go to state.</li>
          <li>Because of my passion for robotics, I was allowed to mentor students twice a week, helping them prepare for their competition while also teaching and holding lessons.</li>
          <li>Recently, I visited the Chicago Auto Show due to my passion for cars. I'll be adding some pictures below, along with those from my robotics experience.</li>
          <li>Anyway, that’s a little bit about myself, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the website!</li>

        <h2>Auto Show</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Here are some pictures I took from the auto show. I'll show the Lexus IS 500, a naturally aspirated V8 with a sleek and sporty look.</li>
          <li>I will also add the Aston Martin DB12 in green. I love how the manufacturer blends luxury, performance, and unique interior design.</li>

        <h2>Robotics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I will also add a picture of an elevator mechanism we made in robotics, which reaches up to 8 feet high. This was built for the First Robotics Competition (FRC) team where students design, build, and program robots to compete in a yearly challenge against other teams.</li>
