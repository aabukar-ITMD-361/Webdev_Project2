        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hello, my name is Ahmed Abukar. I am currently a sophomore at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), majoring in Cybersecurity & IT.</li>
          <li>Previously, I was a computer engineering major; however, I switched my major going into my sophomore year as I figured cybersecurity was a better fit for me.</li>
          <li>I decided to pursue cybersecurity because of its exciting career opportunities. Growing up, I was always fascinated by tech and engineering, so I believe cybersecurity is the perfect fit for me.</li>
          <li>Below, I'll share more about myself and my interests outside of college.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In this section, I’ll provide a more detailed version of myself.</li>
          <li>I work part-time while attending college full-time. I work at a perfume warehouse as an assistant manager, where I interact with customers daily.</li>
          <li>Ultimately, it's a sales position, which I enjoy because of the variety of people I meet retailers and wholesalers, and local customers.</li>
          <li>In addition, I recently interned as IT coordinator for CMSA, where I assisted high school students and teachers in repairing their electronic devices and guiding them how to mkae the most of it.</li>
          <li>I’ve loved FIRST Robotics ever since middle school and have been a part of the organization throughout my middle and high school years. I was the coach of my high school team and had the opportunity to go to state.</li>
          <li>Because of my passion for tech, I was allowed to mentor students, helping them prepare for their college while interning and gaining experience.</li>
          <li>Recently, I visited the Chicago Auto Show due to my passion for cars. I'll be adding some pictures below, along with robotics.</li>
          <li>Anyway, that’s a little bit about myself, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the website!</li>

        <h2>Auto Show</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Here are some pictures I took from the auto show. I'll show the Lexus IS 500, a naturally aspirated V8 with a sleek and sporty look.</li>
          <li>I will also add the Aston Martin DB12 in green. I love how the manufacturer blends luxury, performance, and unique interior design.</li>

        <h2>Robotics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I will also add a picture of an elevator mechanism the students made in robotics, which reaches up to 8 feet high. This was built for the First Robotics Competition (FRC) team where students design, build, and program robots to compete in a yearly challenge against other teams.</li>
